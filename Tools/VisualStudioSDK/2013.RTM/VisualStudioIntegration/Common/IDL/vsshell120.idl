***** General notes for updating this file

***** Proxy Stub

If you modify anything in here, you may need to rebuild the proxy-stub,
msenv110p.dll, and update its registration file,
SetupAuthoring\env\Registry\msenv110p.ddr. To do that, once this file has been
built and published, build from env\msenv\proxies and observe the build output.

If you need to omit something from the proxy/stub file, then put it inside an
#ifndef PROXYSTUB_BUILD/#endif block

There is no need to define GUIDs in external header files such as
vsshelluuids.h. Instead, define the GUID directly within the [uuid(...)]
attribute and use __uuidof in native code.

***** Primary Interop Assemblies

If you modify anything in here, you may need to rebuild the primary interop
assemblies. To do that, once this file has been built and published, build
from vscommon\pias using: 'msbuild pias.nativeproj'

***** PreserveSig

Prefer "nopreservesig", which is the default for all new interfaces, because
it creates cleaner managed code. Managed implementations are free to throw
exceptions which will automatically be translated to HRESULTs in the CLR's
COM interop layer. Native implementations will return HRESULTs and they will
be converted to exceptions for managed callers.

Do not create methods returning S_FALSE. Instead use an additional
"[out] VARIANT_BOOL*" or "[out,retval] VARIANT_BOOL*" argument.

***** Interface inheritance

You may derive new interfaces from existing ones, but avoid mixing
"preservesig" (old) with "nopreservesig" (new). Derive from an older interface
if all of the methods in your interface match the preservesig attributes of the
older interface.

Remember, when implementing a derived interface in C++, you must implement
QueryInterface for the base interface(s) too.

***** Enumerators and bitwise flags passed as parameters:

When a parameter must be exactly one of a set of values (a true enumerator),
the values should be defined and used as follows:

typedef enum __VSSAMPLETYPE
{
    ST_THISTYPE     = 0,   // first value should be zero or one, except
    ST_THATTYPE     = 1,   // in special cases, and following values
    ST_THEOTHERTYPE = 2,   // should use consecutive numbers
} VSSAMPLETYPE;

interface IVsSample : IUnknown
{
    HRESULT SampleMethod([in] VSSAMPLETYPE stType);
}

When a parameter must be exactly one of a set of values (a true enumerator),
and is considered a PROPID, the values should be defined and used as follows:

enum __VSSAMPLEPROPID
{
    VSSAMPPROPID_LAST     = -7000,  // first value should be a unique
    VSSAMPPROPID_This     = -7000,  // number not used by any other
    VSSAMPPROPID_That     = -7001,  // PROPID, and following values
    VSSAMPPROPID_FIRST    = -7001,  // should use consecutive numbers
};
typedef LONG VSSAMPLEPROPID;

interface IVsSample : IUnknown
{
    HRESULT GetProperty([in] VSSAMPLEPROPID propid, [out,retval] VARIANT *pvar);
    HRESULT SetProperty([in] VSSAMPLEPROPID propid, [in] VARIANT var);
}

When a parameter can be none of or a combination of values (bitwise),
the values should be defined and used as follows:

enum __VSSAMPLEOPTS
{
    SO_THISOPTION     = 0x00000001,   // first value should be one,
    SO_THATOPTION     = 0x00000002,   // following values should use
    SO_THEOTHEROPTION = 0x00000004,   // consecutive powers of two
};
typedef DWORD VSSAMPLEOPTS;

interface IVsSample : IUnknown
{
    HRESULT SampleMethod([in] VSSAMPLEOPTS grfOptions);
}

***** Defining properties

Define properties as follows:

interface IVsSample : IUnknown
{
    [propget] HRESULT Foo([out, retval] BSTR *pbstrFoo);
    [propput] HRESULT Foo([in] LPCOLESTR strFoo);
}

Using [propget], [propput] and [out, retval] makes the interface easier
to implement and consume in managed code.

Note: The example above shows a case where the get/put methods accept slightly different
argument types (BSTR versus LPCOLESTR). As long as the equivalent interop types are the
same, this is fine (MarshalAs[..] attributes will be added as necessary). However, this
is typically seen only for string arguments.

***** Array typed args

Pass array type arguments (both in and out) using [] and size_is when the corresponding
size argument is present. You must have the array size as an argument for interop to
work correctly.

interface IVsSample : IUnknown
{
    HRESULT MethodPassesInArray([in] int cItems, [in, size_is(cItems)] int prgiItems[]);
}

DO NOT use [in] int piItems[].

For simple element types, consider using SAFEARRAY: e.g. SAFEARRAY(VARIANT_BOOL),
SAFEARRAY(BSTR), SAFEARRAY(INT), etc. because they interop cleanly to managed code, but
note that there is additional memory allocation and it may not be appropriate for high-
performance methods. Also see the following note.

******* SAFEARRAY(IVsFoo*)

SAFEARRAY(IVsFoo*) will cause MIDL warning 2456:
    SAFEARRAY(interface pointer) doesn't work using midl generated proxy

If you know for sure that implementions will never will never need to be called cross
apartment (cross thread/process), then you can add [local] to the method.

Alternatively, consider creating a custom IEnumXXX interface.

****** Strings

Use "[in] LPCOLESTR" instead of "[in] BSTR"

for faster marshaling and more convenience to native callers.
(But continue to use "[out] BSTR*" for out args.)

Generally, you don't need to specify [in,string] for NUL-terminated strings
because most of the "pointer to character" typedefs are already attributed with
[string]. (e.g. "typedef [string] const OLECHAR *LPCOLESTR")

******* Boolean

Use VARIANT_BOOL instead of BOOL because it interops as System.Boolean instead
of System.Int

However, exercise caution when assigning or comparing to/from C++ bool in native
code because VARIANT_BOOL is typedef'd as a short and VARIANT_TRUE is ((short)-1)

******* Optional (may be null) args

Use [in,unique] for optional input arguments which may be NULL.
Note that pointer_default(unique) does NOT do this automatically.

Do not use [out,unique] because unique cannot be applied to [out]-only top-level
pointer parameters. However, you can use [in,out,unique].

Do not use [optional]. It only works with VARIANT anyway and it's not
obvious for managed coders.

******* [out] NonNullableType*

Note that arguments of the type "[out] Foo* pFoo", where Foo is a "non-nullable
type" such as int, double, VARIANT_BOOL, BSTR, will be converted to
"out Foo[] pFoo" in managed code. This is a non-standard conversion applied by
an IL transformation step during the build for the interop assembly.

******* Service GUIDs

Define service GUIDs via an empty interface derived from IUnknown
and put it inside an #ifndef PROXYSTUB_BUILD/#endif block

******* HWNDs, HANDLE, and other non-marshalable types

Take care if you define an interface with HWND, HGDIOBJ or other Win32
handle types. These typically need to be marked [local] since they
cannot cross apartment (specifically, process) boundaries.
